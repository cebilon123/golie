## About
Golie is an open source file sharing CLI and service application. Share files between your machines (as single copy
just on one work station, or flag them as important to copy them to each machine after change). 

## Where and when we are now?

At the moment golie is a newborn child of mine, which is going to be implemented continuously.

Feel free to watch delivery of one of the greatest (and free) file sharing services!
